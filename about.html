          <p contenteditable="true">&nbsp; &nbsp; During my years of research, I have worked on developing effective wireless communication systems for varied potential applications. My research work has been published in many top tier International Conferences and Journals. Most of the work was initiated and proposed by me and was implemented in my supervisors' mentorship. I have taken advanced courses and have developed an in depth theoretical, and practical knowledge of wireless communication and signal processing through the course-work during my masters and PhD study. I have also acquired advanced technical and analytical skills to perform research activities for wireless communication. I also like to be up-to date with the current and upcoming research trends in the domain, and I try to contribute towards it. The work at Telecom Paris is a part of the industrial project, which has helped me identify critical requirements and develop designs that can support the challenging needs. Furthermore, my contribution in the design of the six-bit digital phase shifter for Stratospheric-Troposheric (ST) RADAR during ME research training at SAMEER has helped me understand the process of prototyping, hardware implementation, and practical design challenges for the development of various wireless communication components. The literature survey and analysis of existing methods have helped me understand the potential gaps and explore innovative solutions. I have mentored many interns and guided them towards research work during my PhD years at IIIT Hyderabad and at Telecom-Paris. I have gained experience in delivering lectures to undergraduate and postgraduate students from my past professional work. I also have gained some knowledge to apply and secure scholarship during my PhD.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Currently, at Telecom Paris, I am working on the business, and mission-critical communication (MCC) utilised by public agencies during a state-of emergency or at critical establishments like airports, transportation, etc. My main aim is to design physical layer transceivers to enhance the coverage of these MCC systems while achieving reliable and secure communication. To achieve this, I designed multi-cell MIMO transceivers operating in a coordinated way. This work has been published in IEEE Globecom2019. Currently, I am working on the design of secure transceivers utilising physical layer security methodologies in the presence of multiple passive eavesdroppers and this work is in the pipeline for IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications (TWC). Along with this, I am also focused on developing deep learning and machine learning algorithms for wireless communication. I utilised a deep learning neural network (DNN) approach in a heterogeneous sub-6GHz and millimeter wave (mmW) network architecture to achieve high data rates and reduced latency. Using advanced deep learning and machine learning tools, we ensure an adequate connection among the communicating units while providing optimal resources throughout the transmission. Part of this work is accepted for publication at NETGCOOP2020 as an invited paper which focuses on optimal mmW base station and beam selection, by only using the available channel parameters at sub-6GHz base stations. I am currently progressing towards the extension of this work for highly mobile environments.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp;At IIIT Hyderabad, my research work involved the design of low-complexity hybrid transceivers for mmW communication networks. Specifically, various complex wireless communication scenarios were considered that include downlink, multi-user interference and relay-assisted designs with half-duplex (HD) relay nodes and in-band full-duplex (FD) relay nodes. The concepts of MIMO beamforming, robust optimisation and hybrid-transceiver design were utilised throughout. In literature, mmW systems has been proposed to be equipped with multi-antennas to facilitate the beamforming and achieve directional gains while overcoming the high path-loss component at mmW frequencies. However, there still exists multiple design challenges due to smaller wavelengths at these high frequencies, and hence, sub-6GHz wireless communication designs cannot be directly utilised. Motivated by this, my research work addressed the challenges of channel-state-information (CSI) impairments, high hardware and computational complexity and limited range in mmW communication. I proposed and developed robust transceiver designs to overcome these associated challenges for different scenarios along with underlying challenges of each of the considered communication scenario, e.g., overcoming residual loopback-self-interference (LSI) in case of inband FD relay-assisted scenario. The work during my PhD has been published in top-tier international IEEE conferences including Globecom, VTC, PIMRC, and IEEE Access Journal.&nbsp;<br></p>

          <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I have always been an active and fun-loving person (Well! at least I try to be on most of the days!). I believe in cherishing small moments of life, which overall summaries happy experiences. Coming from India, dancing and singing on every little occasion has been an active part of my growing up phase. I like to meet, talk, and to listen to people and know their stories. I enjoy food, which has also developed my interest in cooking and experimenting with different cuisines. I love traveling and exploring different corners of the world, and learning about cultures. I root for green earth and strongly believe in the power of each individual in contributing towards it. I am doing my bit in every way possible, and I hope everyone else is too!</p>
